# 3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering


This repository contains the official authors implementation associated with the paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering", which can be found [here](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/). 


I have implemented this on my own datasets. 

Thanks
